## CTS Tools

There are different modes of CTS:
* live, with SDR hardware;
* signals capture via network: simulating SDR hardware via network. In this case you need to install and use CTS client;
* CTS with already recorded signals (iq, wav etc).
 
### CTS client

* [CTS tools](https://github.com/capturethesignal/cts-tools), original, Python2+GNU 3.7
* [CTS tools VM](https://cts.ninja/downloads/)
* [CTS tools](https://github.com/BlackVS/cts-tools), fork, Python3, Tested with Python 3.9
* [CTS Utils](https://github.com/BlackVS/cts-utils), soome additional tools.

### How to run tools
* [Installing tools](cts-tools.md)
* [Receiving signal](cts-get-signal.md)
* [How to run local server](cts-utils.md)
* [How signals are sent from server?](cts-signals.md)

### CTS server
You may run you own server
* [CTS backend](https://github.com/capturethesignal/cts-backend)

## Software
### CTS used
* [GNU Radio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio) is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
* [SigDigger](https://github.com/BatchDrake/SigDigger) is a free digital signal analyzer for GNU/Linux and macOS, designed to extract information of unknown radio signals.
* [Gqrx](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx) is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit.
* [URH](https://github.com/jopohl/urh) is a complete suite for wireless protocol investigation with native support for many common Software Defined Radios.
* [inspectrum](https://github.com/miek/inspectrum) is a tool for analysing captured signals, primarily from software-defined radio receivers.
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is an easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.
* [Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line utility that can convert various formats of computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound files, and, as an added bonus, SoX can play and record audio files on most platforms.
